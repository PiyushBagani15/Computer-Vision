# Face-Recognition-using-LBPH-Algorithm

- Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
- The LBPH is also provided by the OpenCV library. The OpenCV library can be used by many programming languages (e.g. C++, Python, Ruby, Matlab).

# Summary
- Here I have created a python code that will detect the face of the user, if the confidence is more than 85 and the user hits enter, it will launch infrastructure on AWS cloud using Terraform.
- Meanwhile, the photo of the user will be clicked, and as soon as the infrastructure is deployed it send an email to the owner who has launched the infrastructure.





## Technologies used

- Terraform
- Python and OpenCV
- AWS
