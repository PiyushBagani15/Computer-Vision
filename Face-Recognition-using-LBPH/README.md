# Face-Recognition-using-LBPH-Algorithm

- Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
- The LBPH is also provided by the OpenCV library. The OpenCV library can be used by many programming languages (e.g. C++, Python, Ruby, Matlab).

# Summary
- Here I have created a python code that will detect the face of user, if the confidence is more than 85 and user hits enter, it will launch an infrastructure on AWS cloud using Terraform.
- Meanwhile the photo of the user will be clicked and as soon as the infrastrucer is deployed it send an email the owner who has launched the infrastructure





## Technologies used

- Terraform
- Python and OpenCV
- AWS
